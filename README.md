## How to Install 🚀

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Varex Imaging Chat Support Documentation](https://docs.vareximaging.com/) is ready to assist you.

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using Docker to install Varex Imaging Chat Support, make sure to include the `-v open-llm-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-llm-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-llm-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

- To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-llm-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-llm-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- After installation, you can access Varex Imaging Chat Support at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! 😄

#### Varex Imaging Chat Support: Server Connection Error

If you're experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.

**Example Docker Command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```
